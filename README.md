- Any blog article by Daniel Bourke is going to help you get motivated to learn and acheive. Somewhat of a rehash of the previous article, still a quality resource for learning about the exam. He also discusses what happens during the exam and shares his personal exam curriculum in another post [My Machine Learning Curriculum for May 2020: Getting TensorFlow Developer Certified](https://www.mrdbourke.com/ml-study-may-2020/)

### Extras

- [deeplearning.ai videos on Coursera/YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/playlists) — The examination is purely code-based (Python code) but if you want to know what’s going on behind the scenes of the code you’re writing (linear algebra, calculus), I’d jump in and out of videos here as you see fit. For example, if you’re not sure what mini-batch gradient descent is, search “deeplearning.ai mini-batch gradient descent”.

- [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) — If you’re going to be a TensorFlow practitioner, you’re going to need to be able to read the documentation. If you don’t understand something, write the code and comment it yourself.

- [Coding with TensorFlow on YouTube (playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvwLbzbnKJ59NkZvQAW9wLbx) — Most of the TensorFlow in Practice Coursera Specialization in video series on YouTube, taught by the same instructor as well.
